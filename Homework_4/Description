Homework 4
Groups of 2
Read the articles related to SSDs below
You will need three hard drives:
1 magnetic internal hard drive
1 internal SSD
1 external drive (SSD or magnetic)
You will need to use Linux for this homework
Write a report of your findings, using the knowledge from the class and articles to explain why the differences
1. Articles
Read the following articles (expect to have a couple of questions about them in your final)

2. Linux
You are going to run experiments for reading and writing data to your drives

To do so, you are going to need at least a VM that has linux installed
If you are using Windows 10 or 11, you can enable Linux commands using WSL2
In your experiments you'll be using the command dd
Examples of how to use this command can be found in this tutorial

3. Experiments
dd allows us to write and read from the hardware without having to talk to the file system. This helps us to study the properties of the hardware in our system.
From the tutorial above, it shows you how to use the command. Each command will tell you how much data was written (or read), the throughput and the total latency.
We are going to run dd against our three drives
We are going to use values of bs of 256b, 4k, 16k, 256k, 1m and 1g
What do you observe?
What are the main differences between the three drives?
What are the differences in performance when we change the value of bs?
Why we see differences in performance for different values of bs?
Try your experiments with oflag=direct and without it.
How do we explain the difference in performance of these two options?
4. Report
Write a report that contains the following:

Specs of the hardware you used
Version of Linux and dd used
Commands used for your experiments
Plots from Excel or Python comparing the performance metrics obtained using dd
Answers to the questions above
